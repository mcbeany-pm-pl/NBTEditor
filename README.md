# NBTEditor
A plugin that helps you to edit item's NBT in-game
## Usage
Join your server and enter command `/nbteditor` (or `/nbte`). The editor will be displayed to the player as form (menu).    
Make sure you have [pmforms](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/dktapps-pm-pl/pmforms) installed. [FormImagesFix](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/Muqsit/FormImagesFix) is optional, but it makes the form's button icons load faster.
